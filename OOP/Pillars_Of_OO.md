# Pillars of OO

## Abstraction
- Information Hiding
- Only expose what is necessary on interface - the essence

## Encapsulation
- Binding of data and related function together
- Safe from outside inteference
  

## Inheritance
- New objects take on characteristics of another
- Replaced by composition ?

## Polymorphism
- Redefine methods for derived classes
