# Pillars of OO

## Abstraction
- Information Hiding
- Only expose what is necessary on interface - the essence

## Encapsulation
- Binding of data and related function together
- Safe from outside inteference
  

## Inheritance
- New objects take on characteristics of another
- Reuse of existing code - Replaced by composition ?

### Advantages of Composition
- Reuse not tied to creational of hierarchical trees of types

## Polymorphism
- Provision of a single interface to entities of different types
- Redefine methods for derived classes
