# Creational
TODO
# Structural
## Adapter
- Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together
- ```Adapter``` convert interface of ```Adaptee``` to ```Target``` required by client

## Bridge
- Decouple abstraction from implementation so 2 can vary independently

## Composite
- Objects into tree structures. nodes can be treated uniformly
- Children collection
  -  Leaf
  -  Composite (recursive)

## Decorator
- Specialisation of Adapter
- Adding of responsibilties dynamically at _runtime_
  - Subclassing is compile time
- Different decorators add responsibilities to an object
  - Recursive nesting - new decorators not required for _combinations_ of functionalities

## Facade
- Provide unified higher-level interface to a set of interfaces
- Aids loose coupling betweens systems

# Behavioural
TODO
