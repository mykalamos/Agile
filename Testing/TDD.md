# Test Driven Development
http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd
1. No production code unless to make a failing unit test pass.
2. No more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail
  - compilation failures are failures.
3. No more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

- Red Green Blue
- Velocity vs Speed
- Encourages decoupling
- Dovetails with SOLID
- Act as documentation/specification
  - Indicative examples of correct functioning

"The really effective part of TDD is the size of the cycle, not so much whether you write the test first. The reason we write the tests first is that it encourages us to keep the cycles really short."

## FIRST acronymn
1. Fast
2. Independent
3. Repeatable
4. Self-validating - no manual intervention
5. Timely - tests are created before
