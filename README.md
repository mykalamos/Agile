# Agile

Agile has been proposed as an alternative to the Waterfall development process where design and delivery are serially executed steps.

This suffered from frequent failures. Issues with software delivered atomically into Production at the end of the project would include it

1. Not working - i.e. not doing what the developers wanted
1. Not delivering i.e. not doing what the customer wanted but rather what the developer thought the customer wanted
1. Failing non-functional requirements e.g. performance

## Agile Manifesto
https://agilemanifesto.org/

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

| | Value | | Greater Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Individuals and interactions | over | Processes and tools |
| A2 | Working software | over | Comprehensive documentation |
| A3 | Customer collaboration | over | Contract negotiation |
| A4 | Responding to change | over | Following a plan |

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### My Comments
The articles listed above establish an important hierarchy of values.
* A1 and A3 emphasise the engagement of individuals (which is elaborated further in the Agile Principles below)
* A2 seems like an odd juxtapostion to us now but perhaps reflecting the old days when user manuals were more in vogue.
* A4 relates to A3 and the increased iterative flow of information between customer and delivery team. As a general point it clearly addresses the issue of requirement refinement but needs safe guards and a clear rules of engagement with the customer to prevent chaos

### Agile Manifesto Principles

| | Principle |
| --- | --- |
| AP1 | Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  |
| AP2 | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. |
| AP3 | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. |
| AP4 | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. |
| AP5 | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. |
| AP6 | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. |
| AP7 | Working software is the primary measure of progress. |
| AP8 | Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. |
| AP9 | Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. |
| AP10 | Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential. |
| AP11 | The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. |
| AP12 | At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. |
