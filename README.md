# Agile

Agile has been proposed as an alternative to the Waterfall development process where design and delivery are serially executed steps.

This suffered from frequent failures. Issues with software delivered atomically into Production at the end of the project would include it

1. Not working - i.e. not doing what the developers wanted
1. Not delivering i.e. not doing what the customer wanted
1. Failing non-functional requirements e.g. performance
