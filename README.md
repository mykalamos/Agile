# Agile

Agile has been proposed as an alternative to the Waterfall development process where design and delivery are non-overalapping serially executed steps.

This suffered from frequent failures. Issues with software delivered atomically into Production at the end of the project would include it

1. Not working
1. Failing non-functional requirements e.g. performance
1. Not doing what customer wanted
