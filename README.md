# Agile

Agile has been proposed as an alternative to the Waterfall development process where design and delivery are serially executed steps.

This suffered from frequent failures. Issues with software delivered atomically into Production at the end of the project would include it

1. Not working - i.e. not doing what the developers wanted
1. Not delivering i.e. not doing what the customer wanted
1. Failing non-functional requirements e.g. performance


## Agile Manifesto
https://agilemanifesto.org/

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

| | Value | | Greater Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Individuals and interactions | over | Processes and tools |
| A2 | Working software | over | Comprehensive documentation |
| A3 | Customer collaboration | over | Contract negotiation |
| A4 | Responding to change | over | Following a plan |

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
