## Software Craftmenship Manifesto
https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/

As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

| | | Value | | Dependent Value | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SC1 | Not only | working software | but also | well-crafted software |
| SC2 | Not only | responding to change | but also | steadily adding value |
| SC3 | Not only | individuals and interactions | but also | a community of professionals |
| SC4 | Not only | customer collaboration | but also | productive partnerships |

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
